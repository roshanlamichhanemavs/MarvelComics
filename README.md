# MarvelComics

The project request public Disney developer api to fetch characters and comic information.
Mainly the project contains two view-controllers:
    (1) ViewController (Displays identifiers for marvel characters)
    (2) ComicInformationViewController (Displays descriptive information of specific character with their image)
    
Network Manager is created separately to request and handle the corresponding responses.
Using two third party libraries:
    (1) Alamofire (Requests and handles network response)
    (2) Nuke (Download and cache images)

Separated private api key config file.
##Please add api config file separately and add it to configuration (Will add file in email)

Added one test case for Unit testing and UI testing.

Made sure the code compiles without bug. Please let me know if you see any issues while compiling.
